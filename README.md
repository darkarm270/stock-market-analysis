# Stock Market Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using historical data. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to build a robust model that can forecast stock prices with reasonable accuracy.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used for this project is sourced from publicly available financial data, which includes:
- Stock prices (open, high, low, close)
- Trading volume
- Date and time
- Other relevant financial indicators

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
- **Normalization**: Scale the data to ensure consistent input for the model.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculate moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
- **Temporal Features**: Incorporate time-based features such as day of the week, month, etc.

### 3. Model Training
- **Algorithms Used**: Experiment with different machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² (R-squared) to evaluate model performance.


## Results
The project aims to provide insights into the model's prediction accuracy and areas for improvement. Results and visualizations are stored in the `results/` directory.

## Conclusion
This project is a step towards building an effective stock market prediction model. Future work includes enhancing the model with additional data sources, improving feature selection, and experimenting with advanced deep learning architectures.
